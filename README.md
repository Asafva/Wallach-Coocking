#Wallach-Coocking

Ever since I was a kid the two best Chefs in the world were my Mom and Dad. my brother and I always loved to eat what ever they were coocking and never really wrote anything down to remember it.
so I decided to make a Full Recipie site deticated to their amazing recipies, and thus created Wallach-Cooking.

A Fullstack app writting in React+NodeJS+Mongo.
